Amazon wants to maximize the storage capacity of its 500,000 square-foot warehouse by prioritizing a specific batch of prime items. The specific prime product batch detailed in the inventory table must be maintained.

So, if the prime product batch specified in the item_category column included 1 laptop and 1 side table, that would be the base batch. We could not add another laptop without also adding a side table; they come all together as a batch set.

After prioritizing the maximum number of prime batches, any remaining square footage will be utilized to stock non-prime batches, which also come in batch sets and cannot be separated into individual items.

Write a query to find the maximum number of prime and non-prime batches that can be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse based on the following criteria:

Prioritize stocking prime batches
After accommodating prime items, allocate any remaining space to non-prime batches
Output the item_type with prime_eligible first followed by not_prime, along with the maximum number of batches that can be stocked.

Assumptions:

Again, products must be stocked in batches, so we want to find the largest available quantity of prime batches, and then the largest available quantity of non-prime batches
Non-prime items must always be available in stock to meet customer demand, so the non-prime item count should never be zero.
Item count should be whole numbers (integers).
inventory table:
Column Name	Type
item_id	integer
item_type	string
item_category	string
square_footage	decimal
inventory Example Input:
item_id	item_type	item_category	square_footage
1374	prime_eligible	mini refrigerator	68.00
4245	not_prime	standing lamp	26.40
2452	prime_eligible	television	85.00
3255	not_prime	side table	22.60
1672	prime_eligible	laptop	8.50
Example Output:
item_type	item_count
prime_eligible	9285
not_prime	6

--Step 1: Calculate total square footage and nr of items for each item type
WITH summary AS (
  SELECT item_type
  , SUM(square_footage) AS total_area
  , COUNT(*) AS item_count
  FROM inventory
  GROUP by item_type)

--Step 2: Calculate maximum number of batches and items of prime
, prime_area AS (
  SELECT item_type
    , total_area
    ,FLOOR(500000/total_area) AS prime_batch_count
    ,FLOOR(500000/total_area)*item_count AS  prime_item_count
    FROM summary
    WHERE item_type='prime_eligible')
/*The max prime_space is equal total_area*prime_batch_count=499,680*/

--Step 3: Calculate the the space needed for non_prime item by deducting prime_space
SELECT item_type
, CASE WHEN item_type='prime_eligible' THEN FLOOR(500000/total_area)*item_count--similar to line 14 of the prime_area CTE
  WHEN item_type='not_prime' THEN FLOOR((500000-(SELECT total_area*prime_batch_count FROM prime_area))/total_area)*item_count --((500000-(area for each batch*nr of batch))/total area for not prime)*nr of not prime items
  END AS item_count
FROM summary
